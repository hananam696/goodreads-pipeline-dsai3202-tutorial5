# HOMEWORK PART -1
The dataset contains 14 columns and around 20,000 rows, consisting of string, integer, and double data types. From the column statistics, most columns have consistent and valid data. The “publication_year” column has about 13% missing values, while all other columns have 0% missing data. This indicates that the dataset is mostly complete and reliable, with only one field requiring attention. The data quality rule was scheduled to run every Sunday within a 12-hour window to monitor missing values and maintain data integrity. Overall, the dataset is clean and well-structured, requiring minimal preprocessing before feature engineering.
